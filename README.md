# Seed Generator

Welcome! This is my first ever solo hackathon project!

[Seed Gen](https://seed-gen-ubod9.ondigitalocean.app/) is currently hosted on DigitalOcean's App Platform, and will be migrated to [my personal domain](seed-gen.lckd.pw) when my DO credit runs dry / expires! ðŸ˜‰

I am aware of the little bugs and there are plenty of room to improve on the UI!

I intend to maintain this project in the future, as i foresee myself using this for my upcoming projects.

I am more of a Gitlab person, so do [checkout my work](https://gitlab.com/users/lucidkodo/groups) on Gitlab if you want to see what's been keeping me busy!

Thanks for stopping by and have a great one ahead!
